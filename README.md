# **About**
### **A MICROCONTROLLER PROJECT**
Undertale Musicbox is an Arduino device I created to help those relax. Given the task to 'invent, design, implement, document, and demonstrate a prototype of a microcontroller-based product'. The device incorporates **8** core functionalities:

1. Digital I/O - switch
2. Digital I/O - debouncing
3. Digital I/O - LED
4. Analog Input - ADC
5. LCD
6. Timers (other than debouncing)
7. Serial I/O - UART
8. Music synthesis tool (chosen real-world problem)

Please see my report for more details.

# **Usage**
### **HOW TO RUN**
Open the public [Tinkercad link](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6StnqF56pt9) and click *'Simulate'*. Then click *'Start Simulation'* to give power to the Arduino.

![click run](/img/run.gif)

Press the push button to start the music box and listen to the song!

![click run](/img/pushbutton.gif)

You can adjust the tempo in realtime to speed up / slow down the song.

Click on *'Code'* to toggle the code editor and expand the Serial Monitor pane to see messages & timestamps. These timestamps are designed for you to see the intervals between each note, allowing for a more visual depiction when changing tempo.

# **Dependencies**
Autodesk's **8Tinkercad** is required to view and operate the music box online. You do not need an account and you may use any browser you wish. Performance will vary depending on your device / internet connection.'
